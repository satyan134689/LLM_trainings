We’re applying AI to a field where it can make a massive, positive impact: helping people discover their potential and pursue their reason for being. Recruiters use our product today to source, understand, engage and manage talent. I’m previously the founder and CEO of AI startup untapt,\\nacquired in 2021\\n.\\nWe work with groundbreaking, proprietary LLMs verticalized for talent, we’ve\\npatented\\nour matching model, and our award-winning platform has happy customers and tons of press coverage.\\nConnect\\nwith me for more!\\nSeptember 15, 2025\\nAI in Production: Gen AI and Agentic AI on AWS at scale\\nMay 28, 2025\\nBe an AI Engineer and Leader: The Curriculum\\nMay 18, 2025\\n2025 AI Executive Briefing\\nApril 21, 2025\\nThe Complete Agentic AI Engineering Course\\nNavigation\\nHome\\nConnect Four\\nOutsmart\\nAn arena that pits LLMs against each other in a battle of diplomacy and deviousness\\nAbout\\nPosts\\nGet in touch\\ned [at] edwarddonner [dot] com\\nwww.edwarddonner.com\\nFollow me\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nSubscribe to newsletter\\nType your email…\\nSubscribe\\n## Relevant Links:\\n\\n\\n### Link: about page\\nAbout - Edward Donner\\n\\nHome\\nConnect Four\\nOutsmart\\nAn arena that pits LLMs against each other in a battle of diplomacy and deviousness\\nAbout\\nPosts\\nAbout\\nI’m the co-founder and CTO of\\nNebula.io\\n. We help recruiters source, understand, engage and manage talent, using Generative AI and other forms of machine learning. Our\\npatented\\nmodel matches people with roles with greater accuracy and speed than previously imaginable — no keywords required. Take a look for yourself; it’s completely free to try.\\nOur long term goal is to help people discover their potential and pursue their reason for being, motivated by a concept called\\nIkigai\\n. We help people find roles where they will be most fulfilled and successful; as a result, we will raise the level of human prosperity. It sounds grandiose, but since 77% of people don’t consider themselves\\ninspired or engaged\\nat work, it’s completely within our reach.\\nI sometimes have to pinch myself. I’m incredibly lucky to be working in the field of AI at a time when it’s rewriting the boundaries of human and tech possibilities. I’m personally most drawn to applying AI to real world problems, and the specific problem of hiring has plagued me throughout my career. So I’m in the business of finding people their dream jobs — and conveniently, I’m in my dream job myself.\\nBefore Nebula.io\\nYou can trace the roots of Nebula.io to an AI startup I founded in 2013 called\\nuntapt\\n. We built talent marketplaces and data science software for recruitment firms. To start with, we specialized on tech roles in financial services, where there was a huge supply/demand gap.\\nWe were selected to be part of a prestigious accelerator program – the\\nAccenture FinTech Innovation Lab\\n– and we were an\\nAmerican Banker Top 20 Company To Watch\\n.
